You can type fast.. but when it comes to running your code, its difficult to predict how long it will take you to debug what is likely a simple bug that could had been avoided had you just typed a tiny bit slower. </p>\n<h1>I Understand</h1>\n<p>Often times, I code fast because it means I don\'t have to worry about forgetting the solution to my problem, but there are various factors such as interruptions that could also result in my forgetting my solution. For this reason I choose to make sure I have the "cliff notes" version of what my solution may look like, before I type it - for example, as a flowchart, pseudocode or something else. </p>\n<h1>You make mistakes when you rush</h1>\n<p>With this in mind, I try to resist from typing "as fast as I can", I usually make sure I have time to type what I aspire to type in advance, and instead I focus on typing a solution without [too many] careless mistakes. </p>',frontmatter:{path:"/rush-or-take-time-coding",title:"Rush Or Take Time Coding"}}},pathContext:{}}}});
