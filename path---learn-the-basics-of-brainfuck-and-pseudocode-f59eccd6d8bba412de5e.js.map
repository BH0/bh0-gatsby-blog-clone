It assists designers and developers both understand the design requirements of a program such as what the program should do and how the program will achieve what it needs to do. It is important to remember that Pseudocode is not a real programming language, but I tend to imagine it as a simplified programming language (one reason I like programming languages such as Cobol and Ruby is because they resemble Pseudocode).</p>\\n<h2>What is Brainfuck?</h2>\\n<p>Unlike Pseudocode, Brainfuck is a real programming language. Brainfuck belongs to a categorically of programming languages referred to as esoteric-programming-languages (esolangs for short). Esolangs are real programming languages usually designed to prove a point but arent intended for industry standard use. Brainfucks design is incredibly minimlist.</p>\\n<h2>What will be using Pseudocode for?</h2>\\n<p>Brainfuck (for the most part) is not a nice programming language to write in, so to ensure we have a general idea of our program, we will use Pseudocde - which will serve as a suitable reference whilst were developing the actual program. Think of a Pseudocode as a to do list.</p>\\n<h2>What will be making using Brianfuck?</h2>\\n<p>To be honest, I cant really do much in Brainfuck, so we will be keeping things super simple and simply outputting (displaying) a line (or so) of text. This text can be your name, country just make sure it isnt too long - about less than 15 characters will be fine.</p>\\n<h2>Why is Pseudocode important?</h2>\\n<p>While it is unlikely that we will forget the end-goal of this program, for larger programs, it can be difficult (sometimes even tedious) to remember every step to our program, so we use Pseudocode to ensure we know the general outline of our program, then we can pick the language were going to develop it with and get on with other important tasks.</p>\\n<h2>The basics of Brainfuck</h2>\\n<p>Brainfuck has only 8 commands, Most tasks are generally accomplished using a while loop. It is represented by an array (a row) of cells, and has a pointer - which we will use to point to a cell of our choosing.</p>\\n<h2>Brainfuck commands:</h2>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Increment (add) cell value</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Decrement cell value</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Move pointer one cell to the right\\n&#x3C; Move pointer one cell to the left\\n. Output (display) cells ASCII value\\n, Wait for input\\n[ &#x26; ] These are used to signify loops, for the [ unless the current cells value is 0 it enters a loop, for the ] if the cells value is 0, it exits the loop and goes to the next instruction (assuming there is one), however, if the cells value is not 0, it will move backwards and go to the preceding instruction</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Brainfuck (depending on the version) will not read any commands other than the 8 which I have listed, this means that plain text can be written in your program, but to make things more readable we are going to use a # symbol to distinguish between our codes commands from a comment. Comments are simply just notes in the programmer for the developer.\\nI mentioned something called ASCII, on a (common) keyboard, each key has an ID, this ID is known as its ASCII value which the computer uses to associate the key with a particular character.
