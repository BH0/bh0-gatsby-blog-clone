I do however know, that Wordpress.org [the open source tool for developers]  is not a website builder by itself. It does not offer a user-friendly drag and drop interface for the building of websites. </p>\n<h2>What Is Wordpress.org</h2>\n<p>Wordpress [at least ".org"] is a content management system. This means that it is a tool for managing content -  for example, it allows the content manager to easily produce and update content such as blog posts, images, etcetera. </p>\n<h2>But, People Use Wordpress As  A Website Builder</h2>\n<p>This is very true, Wordpress offers something called plugins - installations which add extra functionality to Wordpress, and themes - installations which are for the presentation of content. </p>\n<p>While many themes (some for free, some not) allow their content, and to an extent, their appearance to be easily customizable - their sole intention is simply to present the content in a pre-determined manner. </p>\n<h2>To Turn Wordpress Into A Website Builder You Need A Plugin</h2>\n<p>Plugins come in all shapes and sizes, but I\'ll cut to the chase - there are various plugins which turn Wordpress into a page (and thus website) builder. </p>\n<h2>So, Some Examples Please?</h2>\n<p>Sometimes these plugins have to be combined with other products, sometimes they can be hidden inside themes. And their pricing can vary dramatically. </p>\n<h3>Black Studio TinyMCE Widget  + SiteOrign Page Builder</h3>\n<p>This combination is what I started out with, it is free; but very minimal. </p>\n<h3>Beaver Builder</h3>\n<p>This offers much more flexibility, it offers template layouts - which are pre-designed pleasant layouts. And Beaver Builder\'s user interface is fairly intuitive. I believe there is a free version of it, which is what I used - but in my opinion, the price range is a bit too steep. Having said that, I did like this plugin. </p>\n<h3>Elamentor</h3>\n<p>I cannot remember using this, though I do remember thinking to myself - I need to use this. There is a free version too, and the personal site variant\'s pricing which is for 1 site is pretty fair at $49. </p>\n<h3>Divi</h3>\n<p>This is a heavyweight plugin - in fact, I am not even sure if it is classed as a plugin, long story short - this is way too expensive for me to consider using, however, a lot of "web designers" (I am a web developer) favor this one - probably due to the features its packed with. </p>\n<h4>These Are Expensive For Me</h4>\n<p>Yes, I agree, if you are looking just to build a website for a local small business on a low budget (perhaps even as a favor). these options can feel a bit overkill (with the exception of the free options). But what you should understand is that if you are looking to start a "web design agency" of sorts - these tools are an investment to your business. If your client demands that you specifically use one of these tools - then they should pay for the tool themselves. However, if the client is none the wiser about what you are using, then you should ensure a percentage of each client\'s payment goes towards the tool/s you use. I am sure these plugins easily play nice with other [popular] plugins, but you should try them out - assuming you have the luxury to do so - to find which one you prefer. </p>\n<h3>Why Did I Write This</h3>\n<p>When I first started using Wordpress, I began using it thinking that it was the answer to all my problems, but I soon realized I was wrong - and that it was only a gateway to some of the answers of my problems. The blog post also aims to ensure that you take a step back, and truly consider if Wordpress is the right tool for the job. </p>',frontmatter:{path:"/wordpress-itself-is-not-a-website-builder",title:"Wordpress Itself Is Not A Website Builder"}}},pathContext:{}}}});
